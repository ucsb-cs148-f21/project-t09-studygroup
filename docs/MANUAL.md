# Intended Audience:

The intended audience for this app is UCSB students, professors, and TAs who want to meet and interact more with people in their classes.

# Purpose:

This app is intended to give students the opportunity to find peers in their classes to form study groups with and to chat with. When a student types their class into a search bar, it will direct them to a chat room dedicated to that course, where they can chat and interact with others in the same class. Professors and TAs can also join these chat rooms to interact more with students and to answer any questions.
