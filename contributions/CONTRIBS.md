On the contributions graph it does appear that I have significantly less lines of code compared to my group members. However that is partially due to me not having to commit any large packages or files for my portion of the code. 

I mainly worked on the course search functionality, including the UI and the search endpoint allowing our app to query MongoDB for the most relevant courses. For some of this work I collaborated with Jennice, so the code is committed in her name. Additionally, I worked on UI improvements for the chat room page.
I also worked on design document and user manual so focusing on those caused less commits overall for certain weeks. 

The main contributions I made can be seen in the pull requests I linked below:

For the app, I mainly worked on the Admin Panel and its features. I worked on the UI and adding functionality to the refresh quarter button by getting the current quarter from the UCSB Gold API, pulling the courses for that quarter from another API, and storing it into Mongo DB. I also added a loading display so while the courses are being loaded, the button is deactivated and shows that it is loading.

# Jennice Xu


For the project, I mainly contribute to the couse database constructions, searching bar functions, creating a navigation bar, and changings in user profiles.
In the first few weeks, I was working on connecting the UCSB API course infos into our firebase database (the beginning version before the MongoDB was settled.)
Then, I created a navigation bar that can direct users into different pages in the frontend. After the new MongoDB database was applied, I helped in rebuliding functions in order to
let the search page function correcting in the frontend. In the end, I focused on some minor issues about making the navigation bar/search page/user profile look better.

# Jamie Wang

Joshua and I prototyped the chat room.

I also prototyped google sign in, did classroom drop down, user profile, sign out, quit class, view classmates sidebar. I did lots of these with the help of Joshua.


# Joshua Avery
In addition to doing coding I also did the deployment of the MVP, wrote the final deployment instructions, and deployed the final product. 
I also know a lot about these technologies and so helped people when they were stuck coding, or explained to them the basic steps of how they would want to go about coding certain things.

One of my big coding contributions, among other things, was designing the search for users to invite on the frontend: https://github.com/ucsb-cs148-f21/project-t09-studygroup/pull/70/files
