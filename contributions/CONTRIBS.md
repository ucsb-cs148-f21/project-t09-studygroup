### Anisha
On the contributions graph it does appear that I have significantly less lines of code compared to my group members. However that is partially due to me not having to commit any large packages or files for my portion of the code. 

I mainly worked on the course search functionality, including the UI and the search endpoint allowing our app to query MongoDB for the most relevant courses. For some of this work I collaborated with Jennice, so the code is committed in her name. Additionally, I worked on UI improvements for the chat room page.
I also worked on design document and user manual so focusing on those caused less commits overall for certain weeks. 

The main contributions I made can be seen in the pull requests I linked below:

For the app, I mainly worked on the Admin Panel and its features. I worked on the UI and adding functionality to the refresh quarter button by getting the current quarter from the UCSB Gold API, pulling the courses for that quarter from another API, and storing it into Mongo DB. I also added a loading display so while the courses are being loaded, the button is deactivated and shows that it is loading.
