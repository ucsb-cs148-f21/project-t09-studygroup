For the entire project, I mainly contribute to the couse database constructions, searching bar functions, creating a navigation bar, and changings in user profiles.
In the first few weeks, I was working on connecting the UCSB API course infos into our firebase database (the beginning version before the MongoDB was settled.)
Then, I created a navigation bar that can direct users into different pages in the frontend. After the new MongoDB database was applied, I helped in rebuliding functions in order to
let the search page function correcting in the frontend. In the end, I focused on some minor issues about making the navigation bar/search page/user profile look better.

The main contributions I made can be seen in the pull requests I linked below:
