Our tech stack will be vue, mongodb, and fastapi. Joshua is familiar with using these three technologies in concert. Vue is very quick to use and has the amazing 'bootstrap vue' library which comes with great UI components. Fastapi is a python library. Most of the group is familiar with Python.

Our project is meant to make it easy for people to find the same classes and then communicate with people in those classes. We will have a central repository through which people can search for classes and the join. People should be able to chat with others. Professors can claim the class if they want so they can also communicate with their students. Finally TAs should be able to join as well.

- Manage their class
- Talk to any study group
- Send out mass communications
- View lab partners

Student

# Installation Steps

1. Pull this from the repo
2. Go here and make an account: https://www.mongodb.com/try
3. Make a mongodb cluster. Allow all ip addresses to connect. Create a user. Go to connect your application and create a connection url.
Replace "myFirstDatabase" with "studyapp" replace <password> with your password for that user of the database. Copy and paste the connection url into a .env file in the root folder. `MONGO_URL=<url_here>` This file should model "sample.env" DO NOT COMMIT TO GITHUB OR REVEAL THIS TO ANYONE BUT YOURSELF. 
4. Make a firebase project and replace this config with your own config
5. Make a heroku app
6. Link your heroku app with your own github repo
7. push this to the linked branch on your heroku app

# While developing
`npm install` to get started

`npm run serve` to start the frontend
    
`npm run start:dev` to start the backend (with hot reloading!!)
    
`npm run firebase` to start the firebase emulators
    
`npm run test:server` to run unit tests for the server
    
# Functionality

1. Go to <url>/adminpanel and click on refresh courses. This will load all of the current quarter's courses into your firebase.
2. Go to <url>/ and search for a course by its I.D. (e.g. ANTH 3).
3. Click on the given link and send messages to the chat. Now everyone on that course page can see your messages!
