# Date of Retrospective: 11/17/21

* Led by: Kenneth Wang
* Present: Jennice Xu, Jamie Wang, Anisha Kabir, Joshua Avery
* Absent: None

## Action item

* a goal: make sure everyone is communicating their progress and blockers since we have a short amount of time left
* a change: update our progress in the Slack channel after each pull request that we finish, use the story cards on the Kanban board, make sure everyone has an issue they are working on
* a measurement: the number of status updates given by the group, checking and updating the Kanban board

A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

* We used the quick retro method for our team retro. We each came up with ideas for places we wanted to improve, and constructed a goal, change, and measurement to reflect that area of improvement.

A brief assessment of how it went.

* We were able to openly discuss what we wanted to improve and how we would proceed with the design of the web app as the deadline approaches. 

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?

* I would advise the next person leading a retro to have everyone share their ideas on what they want to improve, so the group can hear everyone's perspectives and have an open discussion on how to make progress towards those improvements.
